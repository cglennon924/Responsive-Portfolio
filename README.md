Bootstrap applications on my portfolio

Created a fully functional nav bar where you can toggle between my portfolio, contact and about me page. I also included a link to my Linkedin account.

I used only the Bootstrap application and no CSS functions. In the time being I believe CSS is easier, but I wanted to use Bootstrap only to see if it was possible to get the desired result.

Included placeholder images across desired pages. Also, had a short bio on the about me page.
